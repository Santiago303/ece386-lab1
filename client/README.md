# Digits Client

The client prompts the user for a path to an image. After hitting “enter” the client makes an HTTP POST request to the server, waits for the response, then displays the prediction integer to the user. 

## Usage

*Replace this line with some steps of how to setup and run the client*
1. Create and activate a virtual environment.
2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run the client. (Replace <server_ip> with the server's IP address and <port> with the appropriate port number) 
python client.py <server_ip> <port>
